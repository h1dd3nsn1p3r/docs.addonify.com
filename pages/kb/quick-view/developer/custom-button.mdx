# Custom Quick View Button

Addonify Quick View also supports custom quick view button. Below is the markup of the custom quick view button: 

```php showLineNumbers filename="button.php"
<button class="addonify-qvm-button" data-product_id="{product_id}">{button_label}</button>
```

You can add custom CSS classes, but make sure to add `addonify-qvm-button` class name as it is a required. You also need to provide ID of WooCommerce product in the attribute `data-product_id`. 

You can have your own button label too. If you wish to have the button label from the Addonify Quick View pluginâ€™s setting page, use the code below:

```php showLineNumbers filename="public.php"
<?php
get_option( 'addonify_qv_quick_view_btn_label' );
?>
```

Hence, except custom button, none of the addonify quick view public assets gets initialized when disable on mobile is enabled & mobile user agent is detected.
