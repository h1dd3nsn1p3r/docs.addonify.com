# Custom Quick View Button

Addonify Quick View also supports custom quick view button. Below is the markup of the custom quick view button: 

```php showLineNumbers filename="button.php"
<button class="addonify-qvm-button" data-product_id="{product_id}">{button_label}</button>
```

You can add custom CSS classes, but make sure to add `addonify-qvm-button` class name as it is a required. You also need to provide ID of WooCommerce product in the attribute `data-product_id`. 

You can have your own button label too. If you wish to have the button label from the Addonify Quick View pluginâ€™s setting page, use the code below:

```php showLineNumbers filename="public.php"
<?php
get_option( 'addonify_qv_quick_view_btn_label' );
?>
```

## Disable on mobile devices

We have added the option to disable quick view on a mobile device since version `1.1.1`. If the disable option for a mobile device is checked in the addonify quick view dashboard setting page, `addonify-quick-view-disabled` class is added to the body.

You can easily hide it with the help of CSS. Below is the example code snippet.

```css showLineNumbers filename="style.css"
/* Example 1: only devices <= 575px */
@media ( max-width: 575px ) {
	.addonify-quick-view-disabled .your-custom-quick-view-button {
			display: none; /* Hide */
	}
}

/* Example 2: or even globally */
.addonify-quick-view-disabled .your-custom-quick-view-button {
  display: none; /* Hide */
}
```

Hence, except custom button, none of the addonify quick view public assets gets initialized when disable on mobile is enabled & mobile user agent is detected.
