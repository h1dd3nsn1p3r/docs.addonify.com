# Quick view general options


## Enable quick view

Enable or disable quick view feature.

## Disable on mobile devices

We have added the option to disable `quick view` on a mobile device since version `1.1.1`. If the disable option for a mobile device is checked in the addonify quick view dashboard setting page, `addonify-quick-view-disabled` class is added to the body.

You can easily hide it with the help of CSS. Below is the example code snippet.

```css showLineNumbers filename="style.css"
/* Example 1: only devices <= 575px */
@media ( max-width: 575px ) {
	.addonify-quick-view-disabled .your-custom-quick-view-button {
			display: none; /* Hide */
	}
}

/* Example 2: or even globally */
.addonify-quick-view-disabled .your-custom-quick-view-button {
  display: none; /* Hide */
}
```


## Hide quick view button for product categories ( pro )

If you do not want the `Quick View` button to appear for one or more product categories, select the desired categories here.

## Enable AJAX add to cart ( pro )
AJAX will be enabled for the `Add to Cart` button inside the modal box, allowing the product to be added to the cart without reloading the page.

## Action after AJAX add to cart ( pro )

Choose the action to perform after a product is added to the cart. There are three options: None, Redirect to Cart page, and Redirect to Checkout Page.



## Enable products view count ( pro )


By enabling this feature, the product view count is stored in the database and can be used for analytical tools.
