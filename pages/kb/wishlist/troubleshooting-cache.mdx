# Troubleshooting cache issue

We all know cache is helpful to speed up our website load time. However, sometimes cache plugins create abnormal behaviour. If you are using Addonify Wishlist & any cache plugin together do not enable the following settings:

- Defer JavaScript.
- async JavaScript.
- Combine JavaScript.

In most cases `defer` & `async` JavaScript will break the plugin functionality. Whereas, in some cases combining JavaScript might also create problems. Feel free to test by combining JavaScript files which might also work for you.

If you are still experiencing the problem with the cache plugin below guide will explain how you can troubleshoot the cache issue further.

## Solution 1: Exclude cookies

We use cookies to save the selected items in the wishlist. If you are experiencing a cache issue, kindly exclude the `addonify-wishlist` cookie in your cache plugin setting.

## Solution 2: Exclude public facing JavaScript file

If your cache plugin is caching the ajax calls made by our plugin you can fix that by excluding it from being cached & combined.

```text
addonify-wishlist-public.min.js
```

The complete URL to the Addonify Wishlist public JavaScript file would be:

```text
http://domain.com/wp-content/plugins/addonify-wishlist/public/assets/build/js/addonify-wishlist-public.min.js
```

**Note:** please make sure to change the `domain.com` with your actual domain name.

If you are not sure how you can exclude the cookies and JavaScript file in the cache plugin setting feel free to contact us or the plugin author accordingly.
