A hook is an easier way for developer to add custom functionality into WordPress themes and plugins. Addonify Quick View has 3 action hook that theme author can use.

- addonify_quick_view_product_image
- addonify_quick_view_product_summary
- addonify_quick_view_after_product_summary_content

All of these hooks are located in `addonify-quick-view\public\templates\addonify-quick-view-content.php`. You can use these action hooks to modify content generated by plugin in the quick view modal. Below is the example: 

```php showLineNumbers filename="functions.php"
function your_function_name() {
  // your code here.
}

add_action( 'addonify_quick_view_product_image', 'your_function_name' );
```
