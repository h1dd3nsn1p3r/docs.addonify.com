# Custom Wishlist Button

Addonify Wishlist also supports custom add to wishlist button. Below is the markup of the custom add to wishlist button: 

```php showLineNumbers filename="button.php"
<button class="adfy-wishlist-btn addonify-add-to-wishlist-btn addonify-custom-wishlist-btn" data-product_id="{product_id}" data-product_name="{product_name}">{button_label}</button>
```

You can add custom CSS classes, but addonify-add-to-wishlist-btn is a necessary CSS class that is used to fire the add to wishlist functionality.

You also need to set WooCommerce product ID in the attribute data-product_id and WooCommerce product name in the attribute data-product_name.

You can have your own button label. But if you wish to have the button label from the Addonify Wishlist plugin’s setting page, use the code below:

```php showLineNumbers filename="public.php"
<?php
addonify_wishlist_get_button_label( $in_wishlist = false )
?>
```

You can also use the shortcode `[addonify_wishlist_button]` to add a custom add to wishlist button. The attributes that can be used in the shortcode are as follow:

- product_id: Product’s id
- button_label: Add to wishlist button label.
- added_to_wishlist_button_label: Added to wishlist button label.
- already_in_wishlist_button_label: Already in wishlist button label.
- classes: Button CSS classes.
- button_icon_position: Icon position, ‘none’, ‘left’, and ‘right’.
