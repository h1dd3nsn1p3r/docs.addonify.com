# License management

All our pro (aka. premium) products requires a valid license key to work. A valid license is also required to get bug fixes, updates, security patches, and support from our team. You are support to **renew the license subscription annually** to keep your product up-to-date unless you have a lifetime license. 

## Get license key

After purchasing a pro product, you will receive an email with the license key. Another way to get the license key is to log in to your [CreamCode account](https://creamcode.org/login). Your login to the [CreamCode account](https://creamcode.org/login) is the email address you used to purchase the product. If you are not sure about the password, you can reset the password from the CreamCode login page.

## Activate license

To activate the license, you need to install the pro addon that you have purchased. After installing and activating the pro addon, you can navigate to the addon's settings page in the admin dashboard. Once you are on the settings page, you will see a section to enter the license key. 

For example, the below license management page is from the [Addonify Quick View](/kb/quick-view) plugin.

Once you are on the license management page, you can enter the license key and click the **activate** button. If the license key is valid, you will see a success message with the additional information about the license. Below is the success message after activating the license key.

## Activation limit

Each license key has a limit on the number of activations. The activation limit is based on the license type you have purchased. For example, if you have purchased a single site license, you can activate the license key on one site only. If you have purchased a 5-site license, you can activate the license key on up to 5 sites.

Let's say you have reached the activation limit and want to activate the license key on another site. In that case, you need to deactivate the license key from one of the sites where you have activated the license key. 

In the order hand you can also upgrade the activation limit by upgrading the license key. If you need to upgrade the license key, you can do it from the [CreamCode account](https://creamcode.org/login).

**Note:** Activation limit quota won't be applied to the unlimited site license. You can activate the license key on any number of sites with the unlimited site license.

## Deactivate license

If you ever need to de-activate the license key, you can do it from the same license management page. You will see a **deactivate** button next to the license key. Click the button to deactivate the license key.

## Renew license

As mentioned earlier, you need to renew the license subscription annually to keep your product up-to-date unless you have a lifetime license. If you have opted to enable the auto-renewal option during the purchase, your license will be renewed automatically without any manual intervention. We will send you an email notification before the renewal.

If you have not enabled the auto-renewal option, you will receive an email notification before your license expires. You can renew your license subscription either from the license management page or from your [CreamCode account](https://creamcode.org/login).

**Note:** The renewal discount is subjected to change. We may increase or decrease the discount percentage without any prior notice.
