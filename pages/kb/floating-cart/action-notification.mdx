# Floating cart action notification

Actions notifications are the feedback messages that appear when a user adds a product to the cart or removes a product from the cart. You can customize the action notification messages from the settings page of the Floating Cart plugin. We have two different types of action notifications:

- Simple message notification inside the floating cart modal/canvas.
- Toast notification alert that appears as a small popup on the any corner of the screen.
